# Queen's Coffee

## Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project by Susana Viruglio

Queen's Coffee is website which has a memory game to entertain the everybody and to test their memory. The only purpose of this project is just Educational. The idea of the name came from my favourite music band which is Queen, my favourite colour is pink and  also I love coffee, so I decided to mix all this to create this project.
My main purpose is entertain and challenge everybody who wants to play:

1. Photos: discover cute coffee faces while you play.
2. Colours: there are 8 different coffee images which I have created all of the with different background colours, 2 whites, 2 greens, 2 pinks and 2 blues; just to make it more challenging.
3. Explanation: the explanation of how to play the game is just at the home page with just a simple image.
4. Timer: I have created a timer to make it more challenging and less boring for those who are really fast.

### External User Goals

* Have fun playing the game.

### Site Owner's Goals

* Same as the external users - make a game that you'd enjoy playing yourself.

### Potencial Features To Include

* Build a simple single-player pattern-matching memory game.
* Clear explanation how to play the game at the index.html page.
* Memory game based on coffee cups which the user will need to find the pair.
  
  
### First Design

I used Canvas to create the design for the project. I chose this image for the menu page and I have decided that it will be the front page. At the beginning, I wanted to create a coffee shop website, but then I changed it for a game keeping the same coffee theme.

On the top left, I have created my logo using Canvas, I have chosen a Sakura flower in this occasion. In the middle, I wrote the name of the website 'Queen's Coffee' and the leaves in the middle are brown which symbolises the coffee grain.
