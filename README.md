# Queen's Coffee

## Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project by Susana Viruglio

Queen's Coffee is website which has a memory game to entertain the everybody and to test their memory. The only purpose of this project is just Educational. The idea of the name came from my favourite music band which is Queen, my favourite colour is pink and  also I love coffee, so I decided to mix all this to create this project.
My main purpose is entertain and challenge everybody who wants to play:

1. Photos: discover cute coffee faces while you play.
2. Colours: there are 8 different coffee images which I have created all of the with different background colours, 2 whites, 2 greens, 2 pinks and 2 blues; just to make it more challenging.
3. Explanation: the explanation of how to play the game is just at the home page with just a simple image.
4. Timer: I have created a timer to make it more challenging and less boring for those who are really fast.

### External User Goals

* Have fun playing the game.

### Site Owner's Goals

### Potencial Features To Include

## DESIGN EVOLUTION

### First Design using *Figma*

#### Home Page
<img src=/assets/images/figma1.png>

#### Game Area
It was my first idea of the game at the beginning.

### First Design with colour using *Canvas*

I used Canvas to create the design for the project. I chose this image for the menu page and I have decided that it will be the front page. At the beginning, I wanted to create a coffee shop website, but then I changed it for a game keeping the same coffee theme.

On the top left, I have created my logo using Canvas, I have chosen a Sakura flower in this occasion. In the middle, I wrote the name of the website 'Queen's Coffee' and the leaves in the middle are brown which symbolises the coffee grain.

### Home page 

#### Header 

The header on both pages have a logo on the top left which a direct link to the home page.

#### Section

On the main section, I have provided the website with an image with the background of a book and a coffee next to it.

In this section the user is able to see how to play the game by looking at the two matching images.
I added the little crown on top of the coffee which it show reference to the project's name.

#### Footer

I dediced to create a very simple footer with the rights of the website; 'Queen's Coffee'.

### Game

Once the user has accepted to play the game they will find a page with the same background color.
As I mentioned previously the header is the same as the home page.

#### Game desing

* Front Card: it is purple with a question mark on top.

* Back cards: there are 8 variety of cards, that the user will find while playing.
All images come from this website link: *https://www.freepik.com/* I have changed the background colour to make it more fun and challenging.
